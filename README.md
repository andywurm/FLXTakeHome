About this template:

The project is split up into three main parts. 

Theres a "Main Page" file, which would be where the hotel information would be displayed after clicking on a hotel from the previous page. 

Then, there is the "Hotel Data" file which holds all the information for that specific hotel including the user reviews for it.

Finally, theres the components which are the different areas displayed on the "Main Page".
